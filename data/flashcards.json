Court submits questions to jury regarding each ultimate fact and makes legal conclusions based on jury findings. Parties must object to proposed jury questions before jury deliberates.\nGeneral verdict with interrogatories: court can require a general verdict and ask jury to answer specific questions concerning ultimate facts.

Answer: X's estate is divided into shares: A takes , B's goes to K; L, M, & N split C's share (i.e., L, M, & N each get );\n  (2) Per capita at each generation (UPC and growing number of states): Divided at first generation with living takers, but shares of deceased are combined and divided equally among takers at the next level. Avoids situations where takers are penalized for having a bigger family. Example: same scenario as above, A still takes , but the remaining is divided equally among B & C's surviving children, K, L, M, & N. Result is that K, L, M, & N each get .",
